# Installing the tools

This page contains OS-agnostic installation instructions for a few of the tools:

### Rust Toolchain

Install rustup by following the instructions at [https://rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs).

**NOTE** Make sure you have a compiler version equal to or newer than `1.31`. `rustc
-V` should return a date newer than the one shown below.

``` console
$ rustc -V
rustc 1.31.1 (b6c32da9b 2018-12-18)
```

For bandwidth and disk usage concerns the default installation only supports
native compilation. To add cross compilation support for the ARM Cortex-M
architecture choose one of the following compilation targets. Use the last one
for the STM32F3DISCOVERY board and follow along with the book.

Cortex M0 M0+
``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

Cortex M3
``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv7m-none-eabi
```

Cortex M4 M7 without FPU
``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabi
```

Cortex M4 M7 with FPU <-- STM32F3DISCOVERY
``` console
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
```

### `cargo-binutils`

``` console
$ cargo install cargo-binutils

$ rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
```

### `cargo-generate`

``` console
$ cargo install cargo-generate
```

### OS-Specific Instructions
